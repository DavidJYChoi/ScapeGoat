# ScapeGoat

Developed a Self-Balancing Scapegoat Tree for CS251 (Data Structures and Algorithms).
The concept behind the scapegoat tree is to reorganize the tree whenever its depth exceeds a specified threshold. When the depth of a node exceeds this threshold, it is considered a "scapegoat," 
and the tree is reconstructed to balance it. This threshold is often set to a value like the logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree. This tree as a result, is able to ensure that search operations are
efficient while keeping the tree relatively balanced.

This Implementation was a part of Project 4/5 of Purdue University's 2021 Data Structures and Algorithms Class under Professor Andres Bejarano.
